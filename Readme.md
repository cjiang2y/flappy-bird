# Flappy bird

## Features
This code features the classic "Flappy Bird" game. In this game, pipes are drawn, which are constantly moving to the left. Then, a bird, which is drawn, has to maneuver through the pipes through jumping and falling. Whenever the bird hits a pipe, the bird dies, and the game ends.

## Files
main.py is the main file of the game. For now, main.py includes all the functionality of the game, including drawing and moving the pipes, drawing and moving the bird, as well as checking the collision. For now, special-effects.py has no code inside, but please add any code that you see fit within special-effects.py!
